IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING LPC SPRITES:

This software is a tool for working with LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) sprites.
The LPC sprites themselves are NOT covered by this MIT license and have their
own licensing requirements.

When using actual LPC sprites (not the placeholder sprites in this demo), you
MUST comply with the original LPC licensing terms, which typically include:

- Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY)
- Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC-BY-SA) 
- GNU General Public License (GPL)
- OpenGameArt.org Attribution (OGA-BY)

You are required to:
1. Credit all contributing artists
2. Include proper license information
3. Comply with share-alike requirements where applicable
4. Make attribution accessible in your final product

For complete LPC attribution requirements, see:
https://github.com/LiberatedPixelCup/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator/blob/master/README.md

This tool is provided to help you work with LPC sprites, but it is your 
responsibility to ensure proper attribution and licensing compliance when 
using LPC artwork in your projects.
